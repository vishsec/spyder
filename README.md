# SPYDER üöÄüï∑Ô∏è
## A Web Crawler for Data Extraction.

A custom-built web crawler designed to scrape structured data (like product listings, hotel information, article metadata) from publicly available websites.
It is being developed as part of my learning journey into backend systems and data persistence using Spring Boot and JSoup.

## Functionalities for now -
- Crawl and parse HTML content using JSoup and returns meta data along with External links.
- Stores data locally using postgreSQL. with JPA as ORM.


## How to run it locally -
- Clone the project to your local machine :
  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/vishsec/spyder.git
  cd spyder
  ```
- Make sure you have maven installed locally and its path defined in ENV of your machine
- install dependencies:

  ```bash
  mvn clean install
  ```
- Run your Spring Boot Application:
  ```bash
  mvn spring-boot:run
  ```
